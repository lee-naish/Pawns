Incomplete list of bugs/limitations

See XXX in code

Check C code output where var is declared in different branches of if/etc -
looks like C var scope is wrong.  Need to move declaration before if and just
have assignment in the branches (treat it like :=).

calling undefine function -> barf(?)

See use_closure_ret in state.pns - can we avoid precondition being added to
post-sharing here?

Type casting in code - currrently looks like
    n = (nil :: list('_type_param'(1)))
ugly A F.  Need to use version of
read that captures (type) var names and effectively have scope
being declaration of function plus function definition. A bit
messy but not too bad. Now redone so type casts rarely ndded - compiler
instantaiates types.

Various things to fix in sharing analysis - see paper for
"final" version of algorithm (that now out of date since abstract domain is
more expressive)

Functions with multiple args, some of which are void cause C
code with void args (error).  eg
ints1 :: bst -> list(int) -> void -> ints
    sharing ints1(a_bst,a_ints,v) = ns
    pre nosharing
    post ns=a_ints.
ints1(a_bst, a_ints, v) = {
    is = cons(4, cons(2, cons(1, cons(3, nil))));
    return(is)
}.
This is a bit of a pain to fix with higher order etc?

Maximum number of args in closure - should use polymorphic
list of args if there are too many.

% f1(a) = r2c1(r2c2(a)).   % XXX should get redefinition error

    sharing analysis of (q_empty)
ERROR: Prolog initialisation failed:
ERROR: assert/1: Cannot represent due to `cyclic_term'
??? works fine with sim.pns...
could be from assert in type_struct/2?

impure function calls in expression - ! gets lost in trf
eg ../examples/dse/sim.pns
numitems = !random_num(void) mod 23 + 1;
