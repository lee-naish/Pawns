% cordlist takes a cord (containing lists of T) and returns
% the concatenation of all the lists.  The lists inside the cord are
% modified (the nil of each one except the last is updated to point to
% the next list in the cord).  Note: the lists in the cord must not
% share!
% We create a pointer to what is initially an empty list and repeatedly
% append lists from the cord onto the end of this list, which we keep a
% pointer to.

        % !x1 is needed above with our sharing analysis.  If the cord is
        % constructed so there is no sharing between branches then x1 is
        % not updated in this call and all is fine.  However, this
        % restriction cannot be guaranteed here and the precision of our
        % current sharing analysis doesn't allow us to express this
        % non-sharing.  Thus it must be left up to the programmer to
        % document this restriction and carefully abide by it: when
        % constructing a cord which is passed here we must not have cord
        % such as branch(leaf(xs), leaf(as++xs)) which share xs.
        % Forcing the programmer to add !x1 above should alert them to
        % this fact.

% given a pointer to a list, returns a pointer to the nil at the end of

% Precise sharing is a bit subtle: arg q shares with result r but we
% know that r points to nil so the elements of the list r points to *do
% not* share with the elements the list q points to.  Ideally we should
% express this (negative) information in the postcondition.

% Safe interface to cords.  Its important that the different lists in a
% cord don't share, otherwise cordlist breaks (it will create a cyclic
% list then loop).  Here we use an interface with preconditions to ensure
% that when we add a list to a cord its doesn't share with the lists in
% the cord already.
